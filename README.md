# KickPi-OS updat

This Github is only used as an update service for an existing KickPi-OS installation.

KickPi-OS is aimed at Amiga friends who want to revive the Amiga experience on a Raspberry Pi.
The focus of KickPi-OS is easy handling and Workbench like "Look and feel" :-)

Software that is installed and pre-configured:

Amiberry,Linux Desktop, Retropie ...
* For licensing reasons, the Workbench files and Kickstart Rom files are not included!

It is a side project of my Amiga 3000 mini to print yourself. But I think it's also interesting for other Amiga friends.

# Disclaimer

The whole thing here is a hobby project. Use at your own risk ;-)
I'm far from being good at scripting ;-) It works.

But: if someone has suggestions for improvement, constructive criticism or whatever - bring them on. 
A warm welcome
