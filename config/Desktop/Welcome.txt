Hello World â€” By different types of programmers
This is a very funny joke not only for programmers but also for neophytes. It is not necessary to read all the coding lines, but make sure to read the statement in the "Manager"-Section. Maybe some of you have already heard or read about this one because it's rather old, but just to re-live the fun, here it goes:

High School / Junior High
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
20 END


First Year in College
program Hello(input, output)

    writeln('Hello World')
 end.

     printf("%s", message[i]);
