wine msiexec /i ~/Downloads/AmigaForever2016Plus.msi

After installation, you need to copy the Amiga Forever into place. These instructions assume that the FS-UAE base dir is Documents/FS-UAE, and that you have performed the Amiga Forever installation using the default Wine prefix:

cd ~/Documents/FS-UAE
mkdir AmigaForever
cd AmigaForever
cp -a ~/.wine/drive_c/users/Public/Documents/"Amiga Files" .
